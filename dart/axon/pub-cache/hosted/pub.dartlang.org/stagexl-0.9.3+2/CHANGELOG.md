  This version contains major changes in the internal render code.
  The WebGL renderer is highly optimized to draw textures (BitmapDatas) but
  does not support vector graphics yet. If you want to draw Graphics display
  objects please use the applyCache method which renders the vector graphics 
  to a texture or do not opt-in for the WebGL renderer.
