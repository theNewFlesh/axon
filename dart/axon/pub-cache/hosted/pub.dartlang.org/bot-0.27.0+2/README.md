# The Dart Bag-of-Tricks
## A collection of (mostly) general libraries to make working with [Dart](http://www.dartlang.org/) more productive.

Starting by porting bits of the [PL javascript library](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/pl) and Google's [Closure javascript library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/) to enable some interesting scenarios.

# Try It Now

The __Dart Bag-of-Tricks__ ( __BOT__ ) is hosted on [pub.dartlang.org](http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/bot). Add the __BOT__ package to your `pubspec.yaml` file, selecting a version range that works with your version of the SDK. _Always check the [BOT page](http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/bot) on pub to find the latest release._

See the [changelog](https://github.com/kevmoo/bot.dart/blob/master/changelog.md) to find the version that works best for you.

# Versioning

* We follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
* We are not planning a V1 for __BOT__ until Dart releases V1.
	* In the mean time, the version will remain `0.Y.Z`.
	* Changes to the _minor_ version - Y - will indicate breaking changes.
	* Changes to the _patch_ version - Z - indicate non-breaking changes.

# Dart SDK dependency

* We're going to try to keep __BOT__ in line with the [latest integration build](https://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-integration/latest/) of the Dart SDK and Editor.
* At this point, each SDK release tends to introduce breaking changes, which usually require breaking changes in __BOT__.
* Keep an eye on the [changelog](https://github.com/kevmoo/bot.dart/blob/master/changelog.md) to see how __BOT__ aligns with each SDK release.

# The libraries

## bot -- default library

 * No dependencies on 3rd-party libraries.
 * Usable for browser-based projects and non-browser projects.

### attached
 * A general model for supporting extensible, runtime-defined events and
   properties on supported objects.
 * This functionality is inspired by the Dependency Object/Property model
   in WPF/Silverlight.

### collection
 * `Array2d`
 * `Grouping` of collections
 * `ReadOnlyCollection`

### color
 * `RgbColor`, `HslColor` with associated conversions back and forth
 * `RgbColor` supports to/from hex

### events
 * Easily raise and subscribe to events with custom, type-safe event objects.

### math
 * Mostly classes related to 2D geometry and graphicsgeometry-related classes
 * `Coordinate`, `Box`, `Size`, `Vector`, `AffineTransfrom`

## bot_async
  * `FutureValue`: an abstract model for async conversions via `Future<T>`
  * `SendPortValue`: an implementation of `FutureValue` using isolates.
