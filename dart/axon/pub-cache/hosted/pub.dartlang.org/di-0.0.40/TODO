transparency:
- runtime check (all deps satisfied?)
- logging
- graph dump
- runtime type check (warning: when overriding a provider with something that does not implement the provider)

annotations:
- injecting primitive types
- injecting dynamic vars
- overriding type annotations
- support multiple constructors ???
- injecting a property (config.baseUrl, rather than whole config) ???

CONFIG:
- allow implicit providers (Type)
