name: source_maps

# Note! This version number is referenced directly in the pub source code in
# lib/src/barback.dart. Pub implicitly places a version constraint on
# source_maps to ensure users only select a version of source_maps that works
# with their current version of pub.
#
# When the minor version is upgraded, you *must* update that version constraint
# in pub to stay in sync with this.
