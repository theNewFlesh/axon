# http

A composable, Future-based library for making HTTP requests.

This package contains a set of high-level functions and classes that make it
easy to consume HTTP resources.

**NOTE:** This package currently only works for
server-side or command-line Dart applications. In other words, if the app
imports `dart:io`, it can use this package.
