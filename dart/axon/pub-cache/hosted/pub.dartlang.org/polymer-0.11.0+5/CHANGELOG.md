# changelog

This file contains highlights of what changes on each version of the polymer
package. We will also note important changes to the polyfill packages (observe,
web_components, and template_binding) if they impact polymer.

#### Pub version 0.11.0+5
  * fixes web_components version in dependencies

#### Pub version 0.11.0+4
  * workaround for bug
    [19653](https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=19653)

#### Pub version 0.11.0+3
  * update readme

#### Pub version 0.11.0+2
  * bug fix: event listeners were not in the dirty-checking zone
  * bug fix: dispatch event in auto-binding

#### Pub version 0.11.0+1
  * Added a workaround for bug in HTML imports (issue
    [19650](https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=19650)).

#### Pub version 0.11.0
  * **breaking change**: platform.js and dart_support.js must be specified in
    your entry points at the beginning of `<head>`.
  * **breaking change**: polymer.html is not required in entrypoints, but it is
    required from files that use `<polymer-element>`.
  * **breaking change**: enteredView/leftView were renamed to attached/detached.
    The old lifecycle methods will not be invoked.
  * **breaking change**: Event bindings with `@` are no longer supported.

#### Pub version 0.10.1
  * Reduce the analyzer work by mocking a small subset of the core libraries.

#### Pub version 0.10.0+1
  * Better error message on failures in pub-serve/pub-build when pubspec.yaml
    is missing or has a wrong configuration for the polymer transformers.

#### Pub version 0.10.0
  * Interop with polymer-js elements now works.
  * Polymer polyfills are now consolidated in package:web_components, which is
    identical to platform.js from http://polymer-project.org.
  * The output of pub-build no longer uses mirrors. We replace all uses of
    mirrors with code generation.
  * **breaking change**: Declaring a polymer app requires an extra import to
    `<link rel="import" href="packages/polymer/polymer.html">`
  * **breaking change**: "noscript" polymer-elements are created by polymer.js,
    and therefore cannot be extended (subtyped) in Dart. They can still be used
    by Dart elements or applications, however.
  * New feature: `@ObserveProperty('foo bar.baz') myMethod() {...}` will cause
    myMethod to be called when "foo" or "bar.baz" changes.
  * Updated for 0.10.0-dev package:observe and package:template_binding changes.
  * **breaking change**: @initMethod and @CustomTag are only supported on
    public classes/methods.
