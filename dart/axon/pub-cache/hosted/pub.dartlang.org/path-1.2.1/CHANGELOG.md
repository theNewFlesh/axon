# 1.2.1

* Many members on `Style` that provided access to patterns and functions used
  internally for parsing paths have been deprecated.

* Manually parse paths (rather than using RegExps to do so) for better
  performance.

# 1.2.0

* Added `path.prettyUri`, which produces a human-readable representation of a
  URI.

# 1.1.0

* `path.fromUri` now accepts strings as well as `Uri` objects.
